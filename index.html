		<h1>Save the Environment While Driving</h1>
		<p>Climate change is a major issue and if it isn’t corrected soon, damage to the environment may become permanent. Transportation is the largest contributor to Greenhouse Gas pollution and creates large amounts of smog pollution as well. Some people don’t have access to good public transportation, thus driving a car is their only option. The mission of this website is to teach you about laws regarding automotive pollution, benefits to increased emissions regulations, and how to find an environmentally friendly car. </p>
