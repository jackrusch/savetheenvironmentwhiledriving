        <p>We have already seen the effects of climate change on our environment. If we donâ€™t act soon, the damage will be irreversible. The EPA has been increasing federal regulations on emissions since the Clean Air Act was passed in 1970. These regulations can be directly linked to improvements in pollution levels. Tailpipe emissions on new cars are at least 98% cleaner than from cars in the 1960s. The EPA banned the use of lead in gasoline in 1995, which saw a significant decrease in levels of lead found in human blood. These regulations have allowed for air quality to improve, especially in cities. </p>

        <p>Gas is expensive, which is why fuel economy is an important factor to consider when purchasing a car. Increased fuel economy standards force car manufacturers to produce vehicles with better fuel economy and therefore cars with better fuel economy are available at a lower price. As concern for the environment grows and regulations become more strict, hybrid and electric-only vehicles are also becoming more popular, pushing manufacturers to make more affordable options. In California, vehicles that are rated to create less smog and Greenhouse Gas are given privileges including better warranties, free charging for electric and hybrid vehicles, and insurance discounts.</p>
