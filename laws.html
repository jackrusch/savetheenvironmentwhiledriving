        <p>In the United States, all vehicles purchased in the country are required to meet specific regulations set forth by the government. In 2007, Congress passed a law requiring the Department of Transportation to set a fuel economy standard of at least 35 MPG by 2020. In 1970, the Supreme Court passed the Clean Air Act which allows the EPA to regulate Greenhouse Gas emissions for all states. According to the California Air Resources Board, 5.4 million tons of smog forming pollutants and 350,000 tons of Greenhouse Gas emissions are produced by California drivers daily. 95% of people in California live in an area that does not meet federal air quality standards. When the Clean Air Act was passed, California was already working on its own emissions regulations. These regulations would be much more strict than those proposed by the EPA. Congress passed an exemption allowing California to have its own regulations, as long as they meet or exceed federal regulations. No other states have been allowed an individual exemption. However, they are allowed to follow California regulations. Currently California, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Washington D.C. all follow these increased regulations.</p>

        <p>To the average person, emissions regulations can be pretty confusing, especially since they change every few years. So, how do you make sure that you meet emissions regulations? It’s actually pretty simple. If you live in a state that does not follow California regulations, you purchased your car in the United States, and you haven’t modified your vehicle’s exhaust, you are most likely following the regulations set by the EPA. Make sure to have your vehicle serviced regularly and repair any emissions related issues. If you live in a state that has increased regulation, check the label under the hood to figure out if your car is 50 state emissions certified or 49 state certified, especially if you are purchasing a new car outside of your home state. California regulations also require a smog test when registering a vehicle. Vehicles purchased new in-state are not required to have a smog test until they are over eight model years old. Vehicles from out-of-state are not required to have a smog test until they are over four model years old. There are many other circumstances that allow a 49 state vehicle to be registered in a state with increased regulations or be exempt from a smog test. Also, some counties have their own specific regulations. For more information please visit the following websites or contact your local DMV.</p>
